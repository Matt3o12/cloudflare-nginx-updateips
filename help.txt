Usage: updateIPs.py [--ipv4-only] [--header HEADER]
Creates a nginx confile file that contains all of cloudflare's IPs so that 
nginx chnages the IP Header to show the visitior's IP address.


It uses the following template:

    20 set_real_ip_from   IP address;
    [...]
    21 real_ip_header     HEADER;

The script loads the addresses from https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4 and
https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6 if IPv6 is not disabled.

You should run the script frequently since cloudflare's IP addresses can 
change at any given time. 


Options:
    -4, --ipv4, --ipv4-only=False   Only loads cloudflare's IPv4 addresses.
    -h, --header=CF-Connecting-IP   Changes the header. 
    -f, --file                      Output file (defaults to the terminal)
    --help                          Shows this help page.
